# Data Structure Implementations

This project is to give me an opputunity to practice programming fundamentals across several languages. 

## Getting Started

Intially I will be programming in cpp, but I will likely add other languages as I continue.

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler Version 7.4.0

## Testing

Initially I will only be proving my code with general example based testing.
